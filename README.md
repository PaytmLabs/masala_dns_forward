# masala_dns_forward

This is a component of the [masala toolkit](https://github.com/PaytmLabs/masala).

This is a chef cookbook providing recipes for deployment of a DNS forwarder using bind. 

It uses systenm packages to deploy bind, and then configure it to be a flexible DNS forwarder, with a default set of resolvers, as well as the ability to specify per-domain resolvers.

The cookbook does NOT perform management of zonefiles, nor acting as any kind of DNS authority.

## Supported Platforms

The platforms supported are:
- Centos 6.7+
- Centos 7.1+

Untested but will take bugs on:
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (And future LTS releases)
- Debioan 8.2+
